        ### Implementation Hints for Copilot
        
        **File to modify:** `src/backend/database.py`
        
        **What needs to be done:**
        1. Add a new entry to the `initial_activities` dictionary with the provided details
        2. Ensure the schedule format matches existing activities
        3. Convert schedule days and times to the proper `schedule_details` structure:
           - `days`: Array of day names (e.g., ["Monday", "Wednesday"])
           - `start_time`: 24-hour format (e.g., "15:30")
           - `end_time`: 24-hour format (e.g., "17:00")
        4. Set `participants` to the provided list or empty array
        5. Ensure `max_participants` is an integer
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - The new activity appears in the activities list when the app runs
        - All fields (description, schedule, max_participants) are correctly populated
        - The schedule format is consistent with existing activities
        - Students can sign up for the activity
        
        **Testing:**
        - Start the application and verify the new activity appears in `/activities` endpoint
        - Test that the activity displays properly in the UI
        - Verify students can sign up if under max_participants limit
