        ### Implementation Hints for Copilot
        
        **Investigation Steps:**
        1. Review the affected component mentioned in the report
        2. Examine the steps to reproduce to understand the issue
        3. Check relevant files:
           - Frontend: `src/static/index.html`, `src/static/app.js`, `src/static/styles.css`
           - Backend: `src/backend/routers/activities.py`, `src/backend/routers/auth.py`
           - Database: `src/backend/database.py`
           - Main app: `src/app.py`
        4. Look for error handling gaps, validation issues, or logic errors
        5. Check for edge cases or incorrect assumptions in the code
        
        **Common Bug Categories:**
        - **Data validation**: Missing or incorrect input validation
        - **Error handling**: Unhandled exceptions or errors
        - **Logic errors**: Incorrect conditional logic or calculations
        - **UI issues**: Display problems, incorrect styling, or broken interactions
        - **API issues**: Wrong response codes, missing data, or incorrect endpoints
        
        **Fix Guidelines:**
        - Make minimal changes to fix the specific bug
        - Add appropriate error handling if missing
        - Ensure fix doesn't break other functionality
        - Add validation if data validation was the issue
        - Update error messages to be more helpful if needed
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - The specific bug described is fixed
        - Steps to reproduce no longer produce the error
        - Expected behavior is now observed
        - No new bugs are introduced
        - Error handling is appropriate
        
        **Testing:**
        - Follow the exact steps to reproduce from the bug report
        - Verify the expected behavior now occurs
        - Test related functionality to ensure nothing else broke
        - Check error messages are clear and helpful
        - Test edge cases related to the fix
