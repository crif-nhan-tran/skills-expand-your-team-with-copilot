        ### Implementation Hints for Copilot
        
        **Files to Consider:**
        - **HTML Structure**: `src/static/index.html`
        - **Styling**: `src/static/styles.css`
        - **Interactions**: `src/static/app.js`
        - **Backend (if data changes needed)**: `src/backend/routers/activities.py`
        
        **UI Enhancement Guidelines:**
        1. Review the current implementation in the relevant files
        2. Understand the current styling approach (inline styles, CSS classes, etc.)
        3. Make changes consistent with existing design patterns
        4. Consider responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
        5. Ensure accessibility (contrast, keyboard navigation, screen readers)
        6. Keep styling maintainable and well-organized
        
        **Common UI Improvements:**
        - **Visual**: Colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, borders, icons
        - **Layout**: Grid/flexbox, alignment, positioning, card designs
        - **Interaction**: Hover effects, animations, transitions, loading states
        - **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, focus states, color contrast, semantic HTML
        - **Responsiveness**: Media queries, flexible layouts, mobile-first design
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - The enhancement is implemented as described
        - Visual changes match the proposal or improve upon it
        - Changes are consistent with existing design
        - The UI remains functional and user-friendly
        - Responsive design is maintained
        - Accessibility standards are met
        - No functionality is broken
        
        **Testing:**
        - View the changes in a web browser
        - Test on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
        - Verify interactions work smoothly
        - Check accessibility with keyboard navigation
        - Ensure no layout breaks or visual bugs
